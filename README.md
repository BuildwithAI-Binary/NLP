# Classification

Here is a simple classification of the tweets and posts collected through reddit and twitter.
We used naive bayes and logistic regression for the classification tasks using count vectorizer.
We achieved desirable results using both but logreg seemed to be doing better than NB.
And then we tried sequence models for better classification.
